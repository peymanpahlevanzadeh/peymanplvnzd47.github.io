## My own thoughts

I am Peyman Pahlevanzadeh. 
I'm a first-year M.Sc student in Communications Engineering interested in the study of quantum computing and information and its applications such as simulation of physical systems, and Quantum Chemistry and Quantum Machine learning using different frameworks such as Qiskit, Mindquantum, and PennyLane. I have experience with basic algorithms of quantum computing and simulation of physical systems such as variational quantum algorithms. In particular, I applied VQE to determine the groundstate energy of d-level systems by mapping them into 2-level systems (qubits).  


## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/peymanplvnzd47/peymanplvnzd47.github.io/edit/main/docs/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown

For more details see [Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/peymanplvnzd47/peymanplvnzd47.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
